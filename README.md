# Project Title
 Frameworks & Intro to JavaScript Project

 ## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

This project contains Bootstrap Basics, Utilities, Forms, Components, and JavaScript Functions.

This is a shortened replica of Nike.com which is one of my favorite shopping websites.  

Some of the Bootstrap components that I utilized are Carousal: which allows the user to scroll through the different local stores, Cards: which I used to display some of the products and bio-depictions. 
I used functions to validate the users email and name, sum up the products total price, search the site for a particular product, and to add an item to the shopping cart. 

## Acknowledgements
I used Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
